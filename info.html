      <h2>My Objective</h2>
      <p>My name is Abul Kalam Choudhury, and I am a driven and motivated Computer Systems 
        Engineering student with a strong interest in building practical, impactful technology. 
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems Engineering at 
        Queen Mary University of London, where I continue to develop a solid technical 
        foundation alongside a hands-on, problem-solving approach. My interests include 
        software development, server and systems engineering, and creating intuitive, 
        user-focused platforms. I am seeking opportunities that align with my skills and 
        enthusiasm, where I can contribute meaningfully, support others through technology, 
        and continue growing as a capable and adaptable engineer</p>

      <h2>Previous Employment/Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Software Engineering Work Experience (Completed: 2024)</h3>
      <p>A short program where I gained hands-on experience in software engineering on large-scale 
        projects. I worked in teams managing complex tasks and built my section of code to integrate 
        with the rest of the team for a functioning product. This experience helped me understand the 
        importance of teamwork, communication, and troubleshooting skills in software development.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>CEF Work Experience (2021 - Ongoing)</h3>
    <p>A work experience opportunity at an electrical wholesaler (City Electrical Factors) 
      that sells electrical components and tools used by electricians, installation workers, 
      and DIY enthusiasts. This opportunity has given me valuable experience in customer service 
      and sales, along with insight into dealing with clients and managing customer expectations 
      at different levels—from walk-in customers to those ordering in bulk for large-scale projects. 
      This job has also taught me about different hardware and their uses in electrical infrastructure 
      for homes and businesses.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Argos delivery driver (September 2025 to December 2025)</h3>
      <p>I was a part-time contract worker for Argos. My duties included loading and driving a 
        long-wheel van to deliver packages to customers and other Argos branches. My duties also 
        included picking items from the warehouse and packaging them to be ready for the next delivery 
        slot, and picking items for other Argos stores for fast-track delivery. This job has taught me how 
        to manage my time efficiently and how to maintain my vehicle, as well as how to manage the stock room 
        and use warehouse inventory software to manage stock and deliveries. This job has also taught me how 
        to drive a long-wheel van and navigate to different locations in a timely manner.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Freelance Work</h3>
      <p>I have created a revision platform along with a service of building and troubleshooting computers for 
        clients. The revision platform is currently under development and will be launched in the future. 
        The computer building and troubleshooting service is currently available for clients, and I 
        have built and troubleshot several computers for clients with different needs and budgets. 
        This work has taught me how to manage my time efficiently, how to communicate with clients 
        to understand their needs, and how to troubleshoot and solve problems effectively. I have also built tech solutions 
        of network attached storages and game servers for family and friends, and have gained experience in 
        setting up and managing these systems.

        <section id="skills">
      <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>My skill set combines practical programming ability with real-world technical problem 
      solving. I'm comfortable moving between writing code, setting up systems, and fixing 
      things when they don't behave as expected.<br> <br>
      I work with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP, using them to build functional, 
      user-focused web projects. I have experience developing Flask applications, connecting 
      services through the OpenAI API, and creating automated systems such as MCQ generators 
      and AI-based marking tools. I'm particularly interested in how software can be used to 
      automate tasks and improve learning and productivity. <br> <br> 
      On the infrastructure side, I have experience building and configuring PCs, running and 
      maintaining Minecraft servers, and setting up NAS systems for storage and backups. I also 
      use Docker to keep services organised and portable, and I'm familiar with tools such as 
      Apache, XAMPP, and GitHub as part of everyday development and deployment. <br> <br>
      I'm strong at debugging and problem-solving, especially when dealing with unfamiliar 
      issues. I approach problems methodically, testing, refining, and improving solutions 
      until they work reliably. I take pride in attention to detail and in producing work that
       is stable and well thought out. <br> <br>
      In addition to technical skills, I bring solid organisational and interpersonal 
      skills. I communicate clearly, work well with others, and adapt quickly in new
       environments. I'm used to working to deadlines, managing my time effectively, 
       and handling responsibility, including customer-facing work and driving long-wheel 
       vans as part of previous roles.</p>

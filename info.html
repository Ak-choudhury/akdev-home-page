      <h2>Previous Employment/Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Software Engineering Work Experience (Completed: 2024)</h3>
      <p>A short program where I gained hands-on experience in software engineering on large-scale 
        projects. I worked in teams managing complex tasks and built my section of code to integrate 
        with the rest of the team for a functioning product. This experience helped me understand the 
        importance of teamwork, communication, and troubleshooting skills in software development.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>CEF Work Experience (2021 - Ongoing)</h3>
    <p>A work experience opportunity at an electrical wholesaler (City Electrical Factors) 
      that sells electrical components and tools used by electricians, installation workers, 
      and DIY enthusiasts. This opportunity has given me valuable experience in customer service 
      and sales, along with insight into dealing with clients and managing customer expectations 
      at different levels—from walk-in customers to those ordering in bulk for large-scale projects. 
      This job has also taught me about different hardware and their uses in electrical infrastructure 
      for homes and businesses.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Argos delivery driver (September 2025 to December 2025)</h3>
      <p>I was a part-time contract worker for Argos. My duties included loading and driving a 
        long-wheel van to deliver packages to customers and other Argos branches. My duties also 
        included picking items from the warehouse and packaging them to be ready for the next delivery 
        slot, and picking items for other Argos stores for fast-track delivery. This job has taught me how 
        to manage my time efficiently and how to maintain my vehicle, as well as how to manage the stock room 
        and use warehouse inventory software to manage stock and deliveries. This job has also taught me how 
        to drive a long-wheel van and navigate to different locations in a timely manner.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Freelance Work</h3>
      <p>I have created a revision platform along with a service of building and troubleshooting computers for 
        clients. The revision platform is currently under development and will be launched in the future. 
        The computer building and troubleshooting service is currently available for clients, and I 
        have built and troubleshot several computers for clients with different needs and budgets. 
        This work has taught me how to manage my time efficiently, how to communicate with clients 
        to understand their needs, and how to troubleshoot and solve problems effectively. I have also built tech solutions 
        of network attached storages and game servers for family and friends, and have gained experience in 
        setting up and managing these systems.
